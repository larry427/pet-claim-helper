# Frontend Design Skill

Create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics.

## Design Thinking

Before coding, commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:
- Purpose: What problem does this interface solve?
- Tone: Pick an extreme - brutally minimal, maximalist, retro-futuristic, luxury/refined, playful, editorial, soft/pastel, industrial
- Differentiation: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE?

## Guidelines

### Typography
- Choose beautiful, unique fonts - AVOID Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts
- Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font
- Use Google Fonts or similar for distinctive choices

### Color & Theme
- Use CSS variables for consistency
- Dominant colors with sharp accents > timid, evenly-distributed palettes
- AVOID purple gradients on white backgrounds
- Black, white, and ONE accent color is a great starting point

### Motion
- Use CSS animations and transitions for micro-interactions
- Focus on high-impact moments: page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay)
- Scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise
- Subtle glows, fades, and transforms

### Spatial Composition
- Unexpected layouts, asymmetry, overlap
- Grid-breaking elements
- Generous negative space OR controlled density

### Backgrounds & Visual Details
- Create atmosphere and depth - not just solid colors
- Gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, subtle grids
- Layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, grain overlays

## Rules
- NEVER use generic AI aesthetics (Inter font, purple gradients, predictable layouts)
- NEVER converge on common choices
- Match complexity to the vision
- Every design should feel intentionally crafted, not default
